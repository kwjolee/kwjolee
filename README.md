## Hi I'm Kwang ðŸ‘‹

I am a software engineer with experience building fullstack applications. I am interested in creating readable and maintainable solutions. 

I most recently worked on [Telegraph](https://telegraph-notify.github.io/), an open-source, serverless framework for integrating real-time notifications into existing applications. Check out the case study to learn more about it!
